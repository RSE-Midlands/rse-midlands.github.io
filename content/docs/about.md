We are a group of people who use or develop research software and work in the Midlands area of England.

We are affiliated with the [Society of Research Software Engineering (SocRSE)](https://society-rse.org/). If you're not sure what a "Research Software Engineer" or "RSE" does, then please check out the [SocRSE case studies](https://society-rse.org/careers/case-studies/).
