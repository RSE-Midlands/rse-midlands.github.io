Monday 24th April 2023 saw the second edition of the RSE Midlands conference. 
This year was hosted by the [Digital Research Service](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/dts/researcher/digital-research-service/digital-research-service.aspx)
at the University of Nottingham’s beautiful [University Park Campus](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/about/campuses/universityparkcampus.aspx), 
and sponsored by [Health Data Research UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/) and by the 
[Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/).

This year’s conference was a chance to build community, meet new and old friends, and learn more about the incredible 
breadth of skills RSEs in the Midlands possess.

The morning had a focus on RSEs in Health Data (applicable to all RSEs, not just those working
in that field), with the afternoon on more general topics. 

Below you will find the arrangements for the day.

## Registration

We didn't want finances to be a barrier to any attendees, and so [the Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org) had generously offered support with any travel expenses. People were able to speak to us if they would have liked to take advantage of this help.

## Location and travel

### Location
The conference was held in Room E06, Monica Partridge Building, University Park Campus. 
This was on the top floor. Stairs and lifts were available, and the building was fully accessible.

### Travel

The University provided information for travel to University Park Campus: https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/about/visitorinformation/mapsanddirections/universityparkcampus.aspx

#### Train
If you were travelling by train, we recommended to travel to Nottingham Rail Station, and then grab a tram (heading to Toton Lane). 
Trams depart from the tram stop above the rail station, accessible from both the main rail station entrance and 
from the pedestrian bridge connecting platforms. Alight at "University of Nottingham" after approximately 10 minutes. The venue was a 10-15 minute walk (uphill, sorry!).

#### Car
If you were travelling by car, the closest public (pay and display) car park was 
[here](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Main+Visitor+Car+Park/@52.940365,-1.1948261,299m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x4879c208ded048ed:0x19acb9ab0140e036!8m2!3d52.9407657!4d-1.1943649!16s%2Fg%2F11sb7cb_9h), 
a few minutes' walk from the venue. 
You might have also wanted to consider using the Park and Ride at Toton Lane (close to the M1). This provides free parking, and a frequent (not free) tram to University of Nottingham.
