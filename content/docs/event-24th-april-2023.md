Monday 24th April 2023 sees the second edition of the RSE Midlands conference. 
This year is hosted by the Digital Research Service at the University of Nottingham’s beautiful University Park Campus, 
and sponsored by [Health Data Research UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/) and by the 
[Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/).

This year’s conference is a chance to build community, meet new and old friends, and learn more about the incredible breadth of skills RSEs in the Midlands possess.

Our organiser committee for this year are James Carpenter, [Andrew Edmondson](https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/it/teams/infrastructure/research/bear/rsg/staff/gavin-yearwood.aspx), [Adrian Garcia](https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/it/teams/infrastructure/research/bear/rsg/staff/adrian-garcia.aspx), [James Tripp](https://jamestripp.net), [Heather Turner](https://www.heatherturner.net/index.html), [Godwin Yeboah](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/research/digitalhumanities/team/contactus/), and [Jenny Wong](https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/it/teams/infrastructure/research/bear/rsg/staff/jenny-wong.aspx).

We want to hear from you, the community, so lightning talk volunteers are also very welcome.

We don’t want finances to be a barrier to any attendees, and so the Society of Research Software Engineering has 
generously offered support with any travel expenses. Speak to us if you would like to take advantage of this help.
