Monday 24th April 2023 saw the second edition of the RSE Midlands conference. 
This year was hosted by the [Digital Research Service](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/dts/researcher/digital-research-service/digital-research-service.aspx)
at the University of Nottingham’s beautiful [University Park Campus](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/about/campuses/universityparkcampus.aspx), 
and sponsored by [Health Data Research UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/) and by the 
[Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/).

This year’s conference was a chance to build community, meet new and old friends, and learn more about the incredible 
breadth of skills RSEs in the Midlands possess.

The morning had a focus on RSEs in Health Data (applicable to all RSEs, not just those working
in that field), with the afternoon on more general topics. 

Below you will find the arrangements for the day. Please look out for a blog post in
the near future, summarising the day and looking forward to the next one!
