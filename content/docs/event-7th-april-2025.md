### Lightning Talks

We are currently seeking **expressions of interest** from anybody who would like to deliver a lightning talk during the day. For guidance, talks should generally be:

- A maximum of ten minutes in length
- No more than five slides

We are particularly interested in hearing about any **practical tips, tricks, and tools** you use in your everyday career, but this is by no means exhaustive; if you would like to propose a broader topic, please do get in touch.

**Submissions from members of underrepresented communities are strongly encouraged.**

If you are interested in delivering a lightning talk or have any questions about RSE Midlands 2025, please contact [James Tyrrell](mailto:j.m.tyrrell@bham.ac.uk).
