## Lightning Talks

Part of the day was set aside for lightning talks from the community, and we listened to people give quick talks.

Talks were generally:

- A maximum of ten minutes in length
- No more than five slides

We loved to hear about the **practical tips, tricks, and tools** you use in your everyday career, as well as the broader topics.

**Submissions from members of underrepresented communities were strongly encouraged.**


## Venue and Travel

[The Exchange website](https://conferences.bham.ac.uk/venues/the-exchange/) should contain all the information about our venue, including a virtual building tour. We booked the Assembly Room for RSE Midlands 2025 and made use of the Shared Catering Lounge during refreshment breaks.

Here is what the website says about travel
(copied verbatim from the link above):

> **Travelling by car**
>
> Centenary Square cannot be accessed directly by car. Therefore, we recommend putting the postcode of your chosen car park into your satnav, rather than The Exchange’s postcode.
>
> The Exchange lies within Birmingham’s Clean Air Zone. You can find out if you need to pay for your vehicle via the GOV.UK website, as well as pay the daily fee (if eligible) after or before your journey.
>
> **Parking**
>
> There is no on-site parking at the venue, however, you’ll find plenty of pay-and-display parking nearby. The nearest multi-storey car parks are Town Hall and Navigation Street, just a 5-minute walk away (0.3 miles). Street parking is also available at Bridge Street, just 5 minutes away.
>
> The nearest car park to The Exchange with designated Blue Badge parking bays is Cambridge Street. From here, the venue is just 192 yards away. A good alternative is Paradise Circus multi-storey car park (243 yards away).

The venue is located within walking distance of several of central Birmingham's major train stations:

> **Travelling by rail**
>
> The nearest train station to The Exchange is Birmingham New Street, a short 10-minute walk away. Snow Hill and Five Ways stations are 0.7 miles away, whilst Moor Street is 0.9 miles from the venue. All are within a 20-minute walk of The Exchange.
