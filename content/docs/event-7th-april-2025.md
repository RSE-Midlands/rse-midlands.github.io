## Lightning Talks

Part of the day has been set aside for lightning talks from the community, and we are very keen to hear from **you!**
If you are interested in delivering a lightning talk, please provide a brief outline of your idea when asked during the
registration process.

For guidance, talks should generally be:

- A maximum of ten minutes in length
- No more than five slides

We are particularly interested in hearing about any **practical tips, tricks, and tools** you use in your everyday career, but this is by no means exhaustive; if you would like to propose a broader topic, please do get in touch.

**Submissions from members of underrepresented communities are strongly encouraged.**

If you would like to discuss your ideas further before registering, please contact [James Tyrrell](mailto:j.m.tyrrell@bham.ac.uk).
