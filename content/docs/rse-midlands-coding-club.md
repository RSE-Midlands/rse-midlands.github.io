The RSE-Midlands coding club aims to provide frequent educational and informative presentations or workshops for Research Sotware Engineers (RSE) or those in RSE adjacent fields. The club will attract speakers primarily from throughout the midlands area to help solidify the RSE Midlands community. We'd love to hear from you about giving a speech or any other coding club queries, if interested please contact Gavin Yearwood [g.yearwood@bham.ac.uk](mailto:g.yearwood@bham.ac.uk)
