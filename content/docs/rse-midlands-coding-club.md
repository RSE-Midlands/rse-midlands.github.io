The RSE-Midlands coding club aims to provide frequent educational and informative presentations or workshops for Research Software Engineers (RSE) or those in RSE adjacent fields. The club will attract speakers primarily from throughout the midlands area to help solidify the RSE Midlands community. We'd love to hear from you about giving a speech or any other coding club queries, if interested please contact Gavin Yearwood [g.yearwood@bham.ac.uk](mailto:g.yearwood@bham.ac.uk)

# Introduction to Docker
**Date**: 18th Jan. 2023

**Time**: 14:00-15:00

*Speaker*: [James Tripp](https://jamestripp.net/)

*Presentation*: [link](https://livewarwickac-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/pssnac_live_warwick_ac_uk/Ed7hQy-QG5VLpPhBamLxyeUBsrX8eu-xvi6q1zn3gjUqMw?e=Aaht9I)

*Abstract*

Docker provides a way to replicate a computing environment. We can then run software within the environment (container) to give us the same result each time, and each container can be generated from a single shareable template (image).  In this talk, James will introduce docker, present some practical examples, and open the floor for discussion. Docker is actively used in research and this presentation will hopefully provide an opportunity to explore how this might help you.
